        Freelance Pi - FINAL MERGED PACKAGE (with Pi API integration scaffold)


        This package merges the professional frontend, backend, and mobile app and includes a scaffold for real Pi integration.
        IMPORTANT: This is a scaffold and requires you to provide Pi developer credentials and to follow Pi integration docs.


        Backend:
- Install: cd backend && npm install
- Copy backend/.env.example to .env and fill in PI_API_BASE, PI_API_KEY, PI_WALLET_SECRET, PI_APP_ID, PI_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- npm run seed to create sample data
- npm run dev to start server
- Expose webhook endpoint /api/payments/webhook publicly (ngrok/localtunnel) and configure Pi developer dashboard to send webhooks to it.

Frontend:
- cd frontend && npm install && npm start
- The Pi SDK is included in public/index.html. Gig page demonstrates createPayment flow using SDK callbacks.

Mobile:
- cd mobile_flutter && flutter pub get
- Use emulator and run. Mobile sample opens payment_url returned by server; integrate Pi mobile SDK or WebView for production.

Security & Production:
- Never commit API keys. Use environment variables and secure secrets manager.
- Verify webhooks using PI_WEBHOOK_SECRET and, where possible, call Pi API to reconfirm transactions.

If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholders with exact Pi request fields if you give me the Pi API docs (or let me fetch them), or
- Deploy this app and set up a public webhook URL and demonstrate a full test flow.
